# When Mitigations Backfire: Timing Channel Attacks and Defense for PRAC-Based Rowhammer Mitigations (ISCA 2025)

## Introduction
This repository contains the artifact for our ISCA 2025 paper:  
**"When Mitigations Backfire: Timing Channel Attacks and Defense for PRAC-Based Rowhammer Mitigations"**

**Authors**:  [Jeonghyun Woo](https://jeonghyunwoo0306.github.io/) (University of British Columbia), Joyce Qu (University of Toronto), [Gururaj Saileshwar](https://gururaj-s.github.io/) (University of Toronto), and [Prashant Nair](https://prashantnair.bitbucket.io/) (University of British Columbia).

This artifact allows you to reproduce the key results for:
- **PRACLeak**: a timing-based covert and side channel attack against PRAC-based Rowhammer mitigations.
- **TPRAC**: our proposed mitigation that eliminates such information leakage.

## Acknowledgement
This artifact builds on and extends the [QPRAC (HPCA 2025)](https://github.com/sith-lab/qprac) artifact.

## Requirements

**Runtime Environment:**
We recommend using a modern Linux distribution with support for C++20. For example, Ubuntu 22.04 or later is recommended if you prefer Ubuntu. This artifact has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and Rocky Linux 9.4.

**PRACLeak Evaluations:**
<!-- To Joyce: Please Fill out here -->

**TPRAC Evaluations:**
- **Software Requirements:**
  - `g++` with **C++20** support (tested with versions 11.4.0 and 12.4.0)
  - `python3` (tested with versions 3.9 and 3.10)
- **Hardware Recommendations:**
  - We strongly recommend using [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) with a cluster capable of running bulk experiments to accelerate evaluations.
  - If using a personal server, we recommend a machine with at least **40 hardware threads with 128GB of memory** to run all evaluations in a reasonable time.

## PRACLeak Evaluations

## Steps for TPRAC Evaluations

Please run the following steps to run TPRAC security analysis and performance evaluations and regenerate results and figures (Figures 7 and 9-12).

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Ensure you have already cloned the repository during the PRACLeak evaluations:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/PRAC_Timing_Channel_ISCA25.git
```

#### 2. Set Simulation Configuration Parameters

##### Using [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)
Configure the following parameters in `./TPRAC/run_artifact.sh` or relevant [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) scripts (`run_slurm_fig*.sh`):
- **`SLURM_PART_NAME`**: Partition name for Slurm jobs.
- **`SLURM_PART_DEF_MEM`**: Default memory size for jobs (recommended: ≥ 6GB).
- **`SLURM_PART_BIG_MEM`**: Memory size for jobs requiring large memory (recommended: ≥ 12GB).
- **`MAX_SLURM_JOBS`**: Maximum number of Slurm jobs submitted.

##### Using a Personal Server
Configure the following parameter in `./TPRAC/run_artifact.sh` or `run_ps_fig*.sh`:
- **`PERSONAL_RUN_THREADS`**: Number of parallel threads to use for simulations.

#### 3. Run the Artifact
Run the following commands to install dependencies, build ChampSim and Ramulator2, and execute simulations.
> **Note:**  Running all experiments on a personal server may take significant time (almost a week). Thus, if using a personal server, we highly recommend first running the security analysis (Figure 7) and main performance experiment (Figure 9) and reviewing the results before proceeding with the full set of experiments (Figure 7 and Figure 9-12).

##### Security Analysis (Figure 7) and Main Performance Experiment (Figure 9)
- **Using Slurm**: Faster (~16 hours on a cluster with 500+ cores).
  ```bash
  cd TPRAC/
  ./run_artifact.sh --method slurm --artifact main
  ```
- **Using a Personal Server**: Slower (~1 day on an Intel Xeon with 128GB memory).
  ```bash
  cd TPRAC/
  ./run_artifact.sh --method personal --artifact main
  ```

##### Security Analysis (Figure 7) and All Performance Experiments (Figures 9-12)
- **Using Slurm**: Faster (~2 days on a cluster with 500+ cores).
  ```bash
  cd TPRAC/
  ./run_artifact.sh -method slurm -artifact all
  ```
- **Using a Personal Server**: Slower (~1 week on an Intel Xeon with 128GB memory).   
  ```bash
  cd TPRAC/
  ./run_artifact.sh -method personal -artifact all
  ```   

#### 4. Collate Results and Generate Figures
After completing simulations, use the commands below to collate results and generate plots. Alternatively, use the Jupyter Notebook (`TPRAC/plot_scripts/plot.ipynb`). Generated figures (PDFs) can be found in `TPRAC/results/plots/`.

##### Security Analysis (Figure 7) and Main Performance Figure (Figure 9)
```bash
cd TPRAC/
./plot_main_figure.sh
```

##### All Figures (Figures 7 and 9–12)
```bash
cd TPRAC/
./plot_all_figures.sh
```

### Detailed Steps

#### Prerequisites
Install Python dependencies, download required traces, and build ChampSim and Ramulator2:
   ```bash
   cd TPRAC/
   ./run_prerequisite.sh
   ```

#### Security Analysis: Figure 7 (Maximum Activations to a Target Row)
  ```bash
  cd TPRAC/
  ./run_fig7.sh
  ```

#### Performance Evaluations: Figure 9-12
**Set simulation configuration parameters:**
- **Slurm**: Configure `SLURM_PART_NAME`, `SLURM_PART_DEF_MEM`, `SLURM_PART_BIG_MEM`, and `MAX_SLURM_JOBS` in `run_slurm_fig*.sh`.
- **Personal Server**: Configure `PERSONAL_RUN_THREADS` in `run_ps_fig*.sh`.
